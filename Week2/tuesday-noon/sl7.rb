# SL7. Valid students are valid students

# You loved the example about students, huh? Let’s student you up then!

# So we are going to do some implementation on this Student class with the following:
# 1. Add a “complete_name” method.
# 2. Add some more validations of your own. For example, we won’t accept students born before 1970 that have more
# than one dog, and we also won’t accept students which have “Llorenç" and "Sharon" name, because we want them to be the only ones in Ironhack <3
# the same with “Nick”, because we love him starting at us doing yoga)
# 3. Finally, remove all the ActiveRecord validations and implement them on your own with the “validate” DSL method. Let’s go, folks!

# Note: you will find a student.rb template file and the student.sqlite database in Slack.
